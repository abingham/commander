The main script needs to replace itself in an [update]
Done that. Hit a nasty dependency.
if I make a change to cyber-dojo and do
./sh/build_docker_images.sh
Then an [update] (eg in a test on CI) will do a
docker pull cyberdojo/versioner:latest
which will have its own COMMANDER_SHA
so it will not replace the cyber-dojo script with the one
from that CI run. The script replacement of cyber-dojo is too complex.
Needs to go. Redesign...
1. cyber-dojo finds the commander sha from versioner:latest
2. docker cats a cyber-dojo-inner script from that to /tmp
3. chmod's it to 700
4. runs it from /tmp
Means update.sh can be run from inside the container.
Only leaves create-start-point which does benefit if you're on Toolbox. Worth it?

readonly VERSION=${CYBER_DOJO_VERSION:-latest}
readonly VERSIONER_IMAGE=cyberdojo/versioner:${VERSION}
readonly ENV_VARS=$(docker run --rm ${VERSIONER_IMAGE} sh -c 'cat /app/.env')
readonly COMMANDER_VAR=$(echo "${ENV_VARS}" | grep CYBER_DOJO_COMMANDER_SHA)
readonly COMMANDER_SHA=$(echo ${COMMANDER_VAR:25:99})
readonly COMMANDER_TAG="${COMMANDER_SHA:0:7}"
readonly COMMANDER_IMAGE=${COMMANDER_IMAGE:-cyberdojo/commander:${COMMANDER_TAG}}
readonly SCRIPT=cyber-dojo-inner
docker run --rm --entrypoint cat "${COMMANDER_IMAGE}" /app/"${SCRIPT}" > /tmp
chmod 700 /tmp/${SCRIPT}
/tmp/${SCRIPT} $@

Note: COMMANER_IMAGE has override for tests and local dev.
Note: VERSION is to allow you try commands on any version, eg
CYBER_DOJO_VERSION=1.2.3 ./cyber-dojo up
to try out 1.2.3 without updating your :latest tag.

=========================================================

Would be nice if the main cyber-dojo script knew
what commander:SHA it came out of. Have [cyber-dojo version]
which reports this. Handy for checking.

=========================================================

CI needs to trigger system-tests

=========================================================

Add -h|--help text for overridable [up] settings via ENV-VAR.

=========================================================

.env files inside versioner have start-point settings like
CYBER_DOJO_CUSTOM=cyberdojo/custom:7d29a75
This does not give the full SHA. Is that needed anywhere?

=========================================================

When you do an up it would be better if this output...

>>checking cyberdojofoundation/csharp_nunit:latest
>>exists cyberdojofoundation/csharp_nunit:latest

Did not come at the start. Start should be...

To set your own password and remove this warning:
   1. Create a file grafana.env with contents
