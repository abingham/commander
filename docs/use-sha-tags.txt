Now allow
$ ./cyber-dojo update [TAG]
which defaults to
$ ./cyber-dojo update latest

The cyber-dojo script will do this...

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#!/bin/bash
# TAG could be a SHA or latest
readonly TAG="${2}"

docker pull cyberdojo/commander:${TAG}

# get the SHA even if TAG=latest
local SHA=$(docker run --rm -i cyberdojo/commander:${TAG} sh -c 'echo -n ${SHA}')

# a safe no-op if TAG=SHA
docker tag cyberdojo/commander:${TAG} cyberdojo/commander:${SHA}

# a safe no-op if TAG=latest
docker tag cyberdojo/commander:${TAG} cyberdojo/commander:latest

# At this point
# 1) we have the image tagged to the SHA
# 2) we have moved the latest tag on.
#
# NOW
# 1) extract new cyber-dojo script from :latest
# 2) delegate the update if --help option was used.

Note that this means update does not have to do anything else.
./cyber-dojo up
will now take care of itself.
If a service's image:tag is not present it will be pulled.
If it is there, it's there! Immutability :-)

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that this also makes an update testable since I can use a
specific TAG in an update command and verify the output contains
the expected SHAs for each service.

======================================================

What about SHA's for tailored start-point images.
I think that's orthogonal. The dot-env-writer.sh
shows the .env values for an _original_ server.
A tailored start-point is layered on top of that
via a command-line argument or an environment variable.

======================================================

$ ./cyber-dojo tags
Could be a new option that displays the SHAs of each service.
It would always look in cyberdojo/commander:latest which
is retagged on an [update].
Handy for testing too.

======================================================

$ ./cyber-dojo update history
Could show log of _all_ updates. This would rely on
the non latest tags in cyberdojo/commander:XXX
being findable. Then sort them by date order.
How to get the date an image was created?
$ docker inspect -f '{{ .Created }}' IMAGE

Note that this does not show the date the specific
tag was first _used_, only when it was created.

Could also show the list of SHAs of each service for
each tagged cyberdojo/commander image.

======================================================

Is there some way the SHAs in production-values.yaml could be
harvested and used in a [cyber-dojo update] command?
Would that even be useful?
