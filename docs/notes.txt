Considering whether to keep commander.
Alternative is a minikube based local installation.
Starting to think this will be overkill.
If starter becomes 3 images how much simpler will
the cyber-dojo script and the scripts it delegates to become?

I can lose some files now
Dockerfile.katas
Dockerignore.katas

Some will go with 3 starter images...
start_point_check.rb
start_point_checker.rb

Dockerfile can lose these lines...
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
# [start-point create NAME --git=...] requires git clone
# [start-point create NAME --list=...] requires curl
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
RUN apk add --update git curl

docker-compose.yml can lose the languages/exercises/custom volumes.

cyber-dojo main script can drop handling of
#  3) ./cyber-dojo start-point create NAME --dir=DIR
#  4) ./cyber-dojo start-point create NAME --list=FILE
So set_start_point_create_volume() can be deleted.
Lines 117-154
Main script will be simpler. But start-point creation will
be handled in alternative script... That does not make sense.
Better for there to be a single script for individual users
and on CircleCI I can curl the cyber-dojo script just so I can
use its start-point commands... that script is 360 lines.
Should be a few less when starter is split into 3 images...


What about :latest ?
I'd like to drop that.
Is there some way the SHAs in production-values.yaml could be
harvested and used in a [cyber-dojo update] command?
